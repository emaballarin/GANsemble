This repository currently hosts what will become the codebase and the *reproducibility machinery* of my BSc thesis in Physics (actually covering topics in _machine learning and artificial intelligence with guarantees_), supervised by [Prof. Luca Bortolussi](https://bortolussi.dmg.units.it/) and made possible by the generous _computational support_ of the [Dept. of Mathematics and Geo-Sciences at the University of Trieste](https://dmg.units.it).  

The entire content of the repository is at a _work-in-progress_ stage and may still be (partly) non-existent, incomplete, buggy or barely working, and will surely go through breaking changes and refactorings. This message will be removed once the codebase reaches an _more-than-acceptable_ stability.
